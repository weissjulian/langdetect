# langdetect
A free, open source tool that detects the programming language of your code on your local device.

Langdetect is there to detect which programming language is present.
It is very easy to use:
* Download the code
* open index.html in a browser
* insert your source code
langdetect is mainly written in JavaScript and can be operated via an HTML interface.
To contribute to langdetect, simply choose an issue or suggest changes based on your own ideas. You are also welcome to add other programming languages. Of course it is also helpful if you create a new issue or report a bug.
langdetect is licensed under GPL 2.
